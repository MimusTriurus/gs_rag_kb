## PR 567
## Date: 2025-06-07
## Description
Feature: Implement pagination for user list API endpoint.
This PR introduces pagination to the `/users` API endpoint to improve performance and user experience when retrieving large numbers of users. It supports `page` and `limit` query parameters, defaulting to page 1 and limit 20 if not provided.
## User description
The user list on the admin panel will now load much faster and allow Browse through large datasets without performance issues. You can specify `page` and `limit` in API calls.
## QA Description
* Verify pagination works correctly for various page sizes (e.g., limit=5, limit=50).
* Test edge cases: empty results, last page, page number exceeding total pages.
* Confirm performance improvement for large datasets (e.g., 10,000+ users).
* Check API response format for pagination metadata (total items, total pages, current page).

## Description
Feature: Add caching layer for frequently accessed configuration data.
Introduced a Redis-based caching layer for application configuration settings to reduce database load and improve response times for configuration lookups. Cache invalidation is handled via a time-to-live (TTL) mechanism.
## User description
The application will feel snappier, especially during startup and operations that frequently access configuration settings, as data is now served from a fast cache.
## QA Description
* Verify that configuration changes are reflected after the cache TTL expires.
* Test caching behavior under load.
* Monitor Redis activity to ensure data is being cached and retrieved correctly.
* Confirm no stale data is served from the cache.

## Description
Bugfix: Fix data type mismatch in user registration validator.
Corrected a bug in the user registration endpoint where an integer field was being incorrectly validated as a string, leading to failed registrations for legitimate integer inputs.
## User description
Users will no longer experience issues registering with valid integer inputs in specific fields. Registration should now proceed smoothly.
## QA Description
* Attempt user registration with various valid and invalid integer inputs for the affected field.
* Verify successful registration with legitimate integer data.
* Confirm proper error handling for invalid data types.
