## PR 1234
## Date: 2025-06-07
## Description
Hotfix: Memory leak in physics engine's collision detection.
This PR addresses a critical memory leak that occurred during complex collision detection scenarios, particularly when a large number of dynamic objects were present. The leak was traced to an unreleased resource in the broad-phase collision resolver.
## User description
Players might experience improved stability and reduced memory usage, especially in physics-heavy scenes or long gameplay sessions. This fix prevents potential crashes related to out-of-memory errors.
## QA Description
* Verify that memory usage remains stable under heavy physics load (e.g., 1000+ dynamic rigid bodies interacting).
* Run the game for an extended period (2+ hours) in various levels to check for memory creep.
* Confirm no new regressions in collision detection accuracy or performance.

## PR 1235
## Date: 2025-06-05
## Description
Feature: Implement new AI navigation mesh generation.
This PR introduces a new algorithm for generating navigation meshes (NavMesh) for AI agents. The new algorithm provides more accurate pathfinding around complex geometry and significantly reduces generation time for large maps. It replaces the older, less efficient system.
## User description
AI characters will now navigate more intelligently and efficiently, especially in maps with intricate layouts. Level designers will also experience faster NavMesh generation times.
## QA Description
* Test AI pathfinding on existing and new maps to confirm improved navigation without getting stuck.
* Verify NavMesh generation time for small, medium, and large maps; compare against previous times if benchmarks are available.
* Check for any performance degradation during AI pathfinding at runtime.
* Ensure all AI behaviors (e.g., attacking, patrolling) integrate correctly with the new NavMesh.

## PR 1236
## Date: 2025-06-03
## Description
Bugfix: Incorrect texture loading for deferred rendering pipeline.
Resolves an issue where textures were being loaded with incorrect formats or color spaces when used with the deferred rendering pipeline, leading to visual artifacts and desaturated colors on certain materials. The fix ensures proper format conversion during asset loading.
## User description
Graphics will now appear correctly, with proper colors and textures, particularly for objects rendered using the deferred pipeline. No more strange greenish or desaturated textures!
## QA Description
* Load various scenes with materials using deferred rendering.
* Compare visual fidelity of textures and colors against expected output (e.g., reference screenshots).
* Test different texture types (albedo, normal, metallic, roughness) and formats (PNG, JPG, DDS).
* Confirm no performance regression in rendering scenes with the fix applied.
