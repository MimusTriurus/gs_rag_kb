## PR 890
## Date: 2025-06-07
## Description
Update: Migrate Jenkins build agents to new Docker images.
This PR updates the Jenkins build agent configurations to use newly built, standardized Docker images. This migration aims to improve build consistency, reduce environment discrepancies, and streamline dependency management.
## User description
Builds on Jenkins should now be more reliable due to standardized environments. Some builds might see minor performance improvements due to optimized Docker images.
## QA Description
* Verify successful builds for a representative set of projects on the new agents.
* Check build logs for any unexpected errors or warnings related to the new environment.
* Confirm correct execution of tests and deployment steps from the new agents.
* Monitor agent resource usage (CPU, RAM) during builds.

## Date: 2025-06-06
## Description
Feature: Implement automatic SSL certificate renewal with Let's Encrypt.
Automated the SSL certificate renewal process for all public-facing services using Certbot and Let's Encrypt. This eliminates manual renewal tasks and reduces the risk of certificate expiration.
## User description
You no longer need to worry about website certificates expiring unexpectedly; the system will handle renewals automatically.
## QA Description
* Verify that Certbot is correctly configured and running as a scheduled task/cron job.
* Manually trigger a test renewal for a non-critical domain (if possible).
* Confirm that new certificates are deployed correctly to web servers after renewal.
* Check monitoring alerts for certificate expiration (should now be silent).

## Description
Bugfix: Correct Prometheus alert routing for critical service downtime.
Fixed an issue where critical service downtime alerts from Prometheus were not being routed to the correct Slack channel and PagerDuty rotation. The alert rule and routing configuration have been corrected.
## User description
Critical service alerts will now reach the correct teams immediately, ensuring faster response times to outages.
## QA Description
* Trigger a test alert for a critical service (e.g., by temporarily stopping it in a staging environment).
* Verify the alert is received in the correct Slack channel.
* Confirm PagerDuty notification is triggered for the designated on-call rotation.
* Check Prometheus alert manager logs for correct routing.
